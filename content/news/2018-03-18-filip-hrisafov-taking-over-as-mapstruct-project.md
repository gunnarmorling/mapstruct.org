MapStruct started the same way as so many other open source projects:
in my day job back then, I was facing a problem;
complex objects had to be mapped forth and back, which was unreliable, slow and hard to reason about with the reflection-based tools we were using.
Code generation seemed to be a much better approach,
as it'd allow for compile time feedback and result in fast and easy-to-debug code.

So I spent some evenings to work on that idea.
Thinking this also might be interesting to others,
I put the first version of the code up to GitHub nearly [six years ago](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/commit/61f181a589564131b1a540e5322ec63d56604870).
And indeed MapStruct turned out to be useful to others, too.
Over the years, it grew a lot in popularity (just in March alone, its artifacts were downloaded from Maven Central more than 900,000 times), not the least by the adoption in the JHipster stack a while ago.
It's used in a wide range of projects at lots of companies.
There are [conference presentations](/community/other-resources/#presentations)
as well as a constant inflow of feature requests in the issue tracker and questions
on StackOverflow.
Heck, people even started to add "MapStruct" to their qualifications on LinkedIn ;)

But most importantly, an active community of contributors has formed around MapStruct, with many one-time contributors, but also with a [hard core](/development/team/) of folks sticking around over the years.
Having the chance to work together with such enthusiastic, professional and friendly community to create and form an open-source project is something I'm very thankful for.

At the same time, I'm working on very different things today than I did at the time of that first commit of MapStruct in 2012.
Hence I'm not facing the problems any more which MapStruct helps to address.
Besides my [day job](http://debezium.io/), I also began to explore some other open-source [endeavours](https://github.com/moditect/moditect) when I got some free time.
This all means that during the last year I didn't spend as much time on MapStruct as I wanted to.

Luckily though, this wasn't a big problem for MapStruct.
MapStruct's community is rather self-organized, so also with me being less and less involved, the project continued to thrive.
Amongst other folks, [Filip Hrisafov](https://twitter.com/filiphr) stepped up and became an invaluable member of the MapStruct community.
After contributing several features himself, Filip got more and more active around reviewing
pull requests, providing help to new contributors, answering related questions on StackOverflow and even doing the last few releases of the project.

So it's with great happiness that I'm announcing that Filip will take over the role of MapStruct's project lead!
Really that's just manifesting the status quo of the last couple of months, where he already was acting in that role effectively.
I'm very excited about this step. On the one hand it feels a bit odd to let go the project I've been working on for so many evenings and weekends, on the other hand I know it's much better to have an active lead with many fresh ideas and a great level of enthusiasm.
After having the pleasure of working with Filip over the last years, I'm convinced he's the right person for the job.

Filip, many thanks for taking over the job and looking forward to many more releases of MapStruct!
